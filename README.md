# Front_End
I'm using this repo to review HTML and CSS
The tentative plan is to brush up on the basic syntax of HTML and CSS then move on to JS and jQuery. 
Once I have a good command on HTML and CSS, the next step is to get familiar with either Vue or React, both of which I think are useful tools for doing front-end work.
