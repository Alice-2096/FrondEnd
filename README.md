# Front_End
A refresher on HTML and CSS 

Recently I've been studying some front-end stuff in my spare time 
The tentative plan is to brush up on the basic syntax of HTML and CSS then move on to JS and jQuery. 
Once I have a good command on HTML and CSS, the next step is to get familiar with either Vue or React, both of which I think are useful tools for doing front-end work.
