# Front_End
A refresher on HTML and CSS 

Recently, I've studying some front-end stuff in my spare time 
The tentative plan is to brush up on the basic syntax of HTML and CSS (I've learned it way back in high school; but my HTML and CSS knowledge is rusty now),then move on to JS and jQuery. 
Ultimately I'd like to get familiar with either Vue or React, both of which I think are useful tools for doing front-end work.
