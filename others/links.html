            Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

            Creating links between pages 
        </h3>
        <p>Create a hypertext link to my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Alice-2096?tab=repositories"> My GitHub</a> (open in the current window)</p>
        <p>If you want to open a website in a <strong>new window</strong>, then use the <strong>target</strong> attribute on the opening <a> tag. 
            <br/ >
            The value of this attribute should be <strong>_blank</strong>.
            <br/ > 
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank"> Internet Movie Database</a> (opens in new window)</p>

            Linking to other sites (absolute and relative URL)
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An absolute URL starts with
                the domain name for that site, 
                and can be followed by the path to a specific page.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. 
                You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.
            </li>
            <li>
                If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is a <a href = "lists.html">link</a>to a html file in my current folder</p>

        </h3>
        <h4> the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to</h4>
        Please <a href="mailto:xj2096@nyu.edu"> email </a> me if you have any questions. 
        <h3 id = "bottom">Linking to a specific part oF the same page</h3>
        <h4> header elements in this example have been given id attributes that identify those sections of the page.</h4>
        <p><a href="#top">Link</a> to the first section of the page using <strong>#section_name</strong></p>
        <p>we can use a similar technique to link to a specific part of another website</p>
