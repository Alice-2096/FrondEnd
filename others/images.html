        <h2>Images</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Include an image in your web pages using HTML </li>
            <li>Pick which image format to use</li>
            <li>Show an image at the right size</li>
            <li>Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages load faster</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. So the first step is to find an image with the right format</p>
        <img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="a dumb photo of mine" title="look at how round my face was" width="100"
        height="100" />
        <p>if you hover your mouse over this image, you can see what i write in the <strong>title</strong> attribute.</p>
        <p>The <strong>attribute</strong>  was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5
            and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images</p>
        <hr>
        <p>now let's try insert this image to the right of the page</p>
            <img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="a dumb photo of mine" title="look at how round my face was" width="100"
            height="100" align="right"/>
        <p>oops, that's a little bit too far to the right...We'll practice more about dealing with images in webpage in the CSS module </p>
